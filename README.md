# Examples of backpropagation in PyTorch
============

A theory is a little bit different from practice in terms of backpropagation.
in this repositary, you can find calculations of backpropagation that PyTorch
is doing behind the scenes. I used code from official pytorch/pytorch 
repo that you can find here: 
[https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
to make the process easy to understand.
